# Setup {#setup}

Some packages (including those from openvolley project) are hosted on GitHub. You will need the `remotes` package to install these, so first install that if needed:

```{r remotes}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("remotes")
```

Volleyball-specific packages:

For users working with DataVolley files:

```{r vpkgs1, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("openvolley/datavolley")

```

VBStats users will additionally need the `peranavolley` package:

```{r vpkgs2, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("openvolley/peranavolley")

```

## Example data

Load some data that we'll use in this document for illustrative purposes:

```{r exampledata}
x <- dv_read(dv_example_file(1))
px <- plays(x)

summary(x)
```
