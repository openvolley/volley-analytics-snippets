# Introduction

This document provides some code snippets and guidance that might help you with volleyball analytics in R, and in particular with the `openvolley` family of packages.

## openvolley {-}

The openvolley project aims to provide an open-source, freely available software ecosystem to support volleyball analytics. It consists of a family of add-on packages that can be used with the R software package. R provides an enormous range of data manipulation, analysis, modelling, and graphical display functionality, including the ability to build interactive data analysis and visualisation apps.

See http://openvolley.org.

## Contributing {-}

Have some code or corrections that you'd like to contribute to this project? Or a request for something you'd like to see covered? Please join in! Either:

- [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openvolley/volley-analytics-snippets), create a new branch with your changes, and submit a pull request; or
- open [an issue](https://github.com/openvolley/volley-analytics-snippets/issues) (especially for requests); or
- contact the maintainers directly.

Maintainers and contributors must follow this project's [code of conduct](https://github.com/openvolley/volley-analytics-snippets/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Contribution guidelines {-}

- if you are forking the repo and submitting a pull request, please create a new branch and make your changes there
- please follow the existing code styling and conventions
- existing examples typically use tidyverse functions (e.g. using `x %>% dplyr::filter(blah)` rather than direct dataframe-indexing like `x[blah, ]`) --- but base R code is perfectly fine too, particularly if it's easier to understand
- if your code example should actually run and show an output, use `x` and/or `px` as your data inputs if possible. These are from the example file bundled with the datavolley package:
  ```{r egdata, eval = FALSE}
  x <- dv_read(dv_example_file())
  px <- plays(x)
  ```
  Note that this example file does not have some information scouted (e.g. attack or serve coordinates).
- be aware that the project maintainers might modify your code to better fit the existing code style and document structure.
