# Introduction

This document provides some code snippets and guidance that might help you with volleyball analytics in R, and in particular with the `openvolley` family of packages.

## openvolley {-}

The openvolley project aims to provide an open-source, freely available software ecosystem to support volleyball analytics. It consists of a family of add-on packages that can be used with the R software package. R provides an enormous range of data manipulation, analysis, modelling, and graphical display functionality, including the ability to build interactive data analysis and visualisation apps.
